## Project Description

With this project I take a solo beginner's dive into a functioning webpage that needs some tender love and care to be the best webpage it can be.

With the addition of some flex-box, a fixed navigation link, a few media queries and a special focus on semantical HTML the page now functions responsively, reforming its metaphorical flow from that of a raging river to a calm creek. An attention to accessibility was introduced as well.

The main challenge faced in this endeavor manifested mainly in the need to use existing code that was not set up in the most efficient way to begin with. However, the goals for the project were met plus a little bit extra flavor on top to really make the page pop.
